                    <p>
                        The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology (B.Sc.CSIT)
                        curriculum is designed by closely following the courses practiced in accredited international
                        universities, subject to the condition that the intake students are twelve years of schooling in
                        the
                        science stream or equivalent from any university recognized by Tribhuvan University (TU). In
                        addition to the foundation and core Computer Science and Information Technology courses, the
                        program offers several elective courses to fulfill the demand of high technology applications
                        development. The foundation and core courses are designed to meet the undergraduate academic
                        program requirement, and the service courses are designed to meet the need of fast changing
                        computer technology and application. Students enrolled in the four year B.Sc.CSIT program are
                        required to take courses in design and implementation of computer software systems, foundation
                        in the theoretical model of computer science, and a functional background of computer
                        hardware. All undergraduate students are required to complete 126 credit hours of computer
                        science course and allied courses.
