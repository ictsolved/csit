                        responsibilities in these
                        terms. We also provide you a way to contact us, provide feedback/suggestion, report bug and
                        request feature. It

                    <h4 class="heading-4">3. Content in CSIT Tutor</h4>
                    <h4 class="heading-4">Our Content</h4>
                    <p>
                        CSIT Tutor include contents that belong to CSIT Tutor - for example, many reference materials
                        you find in the
                        application. You may use CSIT Tutor&#39;s content as allowed by these terms, but we retain any
                        intellectual
                        property
                        rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos,
                        or legal
                        notices.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="heading-4">Other Content</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some of our features give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations —
                        for example,
                        notices published by IOST, or job that appears in our job search. You may not use this content
                        without that
                        person or
                        organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people
                        or organizations’
                        content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect CSIT Tutor&#39;s views.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are the content owner and you don&#39;t want your content to appear in CSIT Tutor, then
                        you can request
                        for the removal of your content through our &quot;Send Feedback&quot; option available in home
                        screen of the
                        application. We will remove the content after verifying it is indeed your content.
                    </p>
