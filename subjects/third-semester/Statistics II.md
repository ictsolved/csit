The course consists of concepts of sampling, testing hypothesis, parametric
and non parametric tests, correlation and regression, experimental designs and stochastic
processes.

The main objective of the course is to acquire the theoretical as well as
practical knowledge of estimation, testing of hypothesis, application of parametric and non-
parametric statistical tests, design of experiments, multiple regression analysis, and basic concept
of stochastic process with special focus to data/problems related with computer science and
information technology
