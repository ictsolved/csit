description: "Image Processing covers the investigation, creation and manipulation of digital
images by computer. The course consists of theoretical material introducing the mathematics of
images and imaging. Topics include representation of two-dimensional data, time and frequency
domain representations, filtering and enhancement, the Fourier transform, convolution,
interpolation. The student will become familiar with Image Enhancement, Image Restoration,
Image Compression, Morphological Image Processing, Image Segmentation, Representation and
Description, and Object Recognition."

The objective of this course is to make students able to:
1. develop a theoretical foundation of Digital Image Processing concepts.
2. provide mathematical foundations for digital manipulation of images; image acquisition;
preprocessing; segmentation; Fourier domain processing; and compression.
3. gain experience and practical techniques to write programs for digital manipulation of
images; image acquisition; preprocessing; segmentation; Fourier domain processing; and
compression.
